## Pull Request Process

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/my-feature`)
3. Make your changes
4. Run tests and linting:
   ```bash
   cargo fmt
   cargo clippy
   cargo test
   ```
5. Commit with a clear message
6. Push and open a PR

### PR Expectations

- Describe what the PR does and why
- Keep changes focused (one feature/fix per PR)
- Update documentation if needed
- Add tests for new functionality

## Reporting Issues

- Search existing issues first
- Include reproduction steps for bugs
- Include Rust version (`rustc --version`) and OS
- Be specific about expected vs actual behavior

## AI-Assisted Development

AI coding assistants are encouraged for contributing to this project. Tools like [Amp Code](https://ampcode.com), [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code), Cursor, and similar assistants can significantly accelerate development.

### Quality Requirements

AI-generated code must meet the same standards as human-written code:

- **All tests must pass genuinely** - Tests verify actual behavior, not just compile
- **No stubbed tests** - Never use `todo!()`, `unimplemented!()`, or hardcoded expected values to make tests pass artificially
- **No skipped assertions** - Every test must assert meaningful behavior
- **Review critically** - Understand and verify all generated code before committing

### Feature Design Workflow

For new features or significant changes:

1. **Check existing designs** - Review `docs/features/` for related design docs
2. **Write a design doc** - For new features, create `docs/features/FEATURE_NAME.md`
3. **Implement in phases** - Break large features into phases as shown in the design doc
4. **Test thoroughly** - Add tests that verify the design requirements
5. **Reference in PR** - Link to the design doc in your pull request

### Modes of Work

When starting an AI session, consider which mode you're in:

| Mode        | Purpose                            | Example                              |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Build**   | New functionality                  | "Implement sample command (Phase 1)" |
| **Improve** | Refactor without changing behavior | "Extract sampler module"             |
| **Sweep**   | Fix related bugs                   | "Fix all INSERT parsing edge cases"  |

This prevents scope creep and keeps AI contributions focused.

## Code of Conduct

Be respectful and constructive. We're all here to build something useful.

- Be welcoming to newcomers
- Accept constructive criticism gracefully
- Focus on what's best for the project
- Show empathy towards others
