# Code of Conduct

This is a simple, direct code of conduct. No corporate speak, just common sense.

## The Basics

1. **Be respectful.** Disagree with ideas, not people. No personal attacks, harassment, or discrimination.

2. **Be constructive.** Criticism is welcome when it comes with specifics. "This is bad" helps no one. "This could be improved by X because Y" does.

3. **Be concrete.** Vague complaints waste everyone's time. Provide details, reproduction steps, and examples.

4. **Respect tool choices.** Contributors may use any tools they find effective, including AI assistants. Dismissing work as "AI slop" or similar without substantive critique is not constructive. Judge contributions on their quality and correctness, not on how they were created.

5. **Stay focused.** Keep discussions on topic. This is a SQL file splitter, not a platform for unrelated debates.

## What We Won't Tolerate

- Harassment or discrimination of any kind
- Harassment or gatekeeping based on tool usage (including AI assistants)
- Personal attacks or insults
- Spam or self-promotion
- Deliberately disruptive behavior

## Enforcement

Maintainers may remove, edit, or reject contributions that don't align with this code of conduct. Repeated violations may result in being blocked from the project.

## Questions?

If something's unclear, ask. Good faith questions are always welcome.
