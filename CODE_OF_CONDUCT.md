# Code of Conduct

This is a simple, direct code of conduct. No corporate speak, just common sense.

## The Basics

1. **Be respectful.** Disagree with ideas, not people. No personal attacks, harassment, or discrimination.

2. **Be constructive.** Criticism is welcome when it comes with specifics. "This is bad" helps no one. "This could be improved by X because Y" does.

3. **Be concrete.** Vague complaints waste everyone's time. Provide details, reproduction steps, and examples.

4. **Don't be dismissive.** Labeling work as "AI slop" or similar without substantive critique is not constructive. If something needs improvement, explain what and why.

5. **Stay focused.** Keep discussions on topic. This is a SQL file splitter, not a platform for unrelated debates.

## What We Won't Tolerate

- Harassment or discrimination of any kind
- Personal attacks or insults
- Spam or self-promotion
- Deliberately disruptive behavior

## Enforcement

Maintainers may remove, edit, or reject contributions that don't align with this code of conduct. Repeated violations may result in being blocked from the project.

## Questions?

If something's unclear, ask. Good faith questions are always welcome.
